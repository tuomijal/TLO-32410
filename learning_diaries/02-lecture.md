*NOTE: I will switch the language of my notes to English so that language is consistent throughout the repository. It also allows the teacher to delegate some tasks to the TA if necessary.*

Today we discussed the essence of data science in more detail and also had some practical takes on scraping and pandas. I must say I really enjoy the integrative and associate take the lecturer has on the subject. He is able to tie real-world examples into the subjects making them more concrete and interesting.

Most interesting was the division of data science into four subcategories:

1. Descriptive analytics
2. Diagnostics analytics
3. Prescriptive analytics
4. Predictive analytics

This is a powerful framework since it highlights the value in each of the category. I think that ever since the machine learning boom all interest has been focused on *predictive analytics* even to the extent of considering it as a synonym to data science. This however is obiviously not true. As was discussed in the first lecture, human learning enabled by *descriptive analytics* can be just as powerful as *machine learning* in case where data has not been understood yet. This is important from analysists personal perspective since predictive analytics is technically much harder than descriptive, diagnostics or prescriptive analytics. It doesn't mean that analysist in unable to provide value if he/she lacks in one of the four subdivisions.

I think this structure also works a chronological guide into data science projects. Especially in my own work I have had the tendency to jump into point 4 and start making predictions right away. I believe it might be beneficial to walk through the previous steps carefully prior to trying to make predictions.

It was also interesting to hear about the level of analytical capability in companies. It would be nice to see some subgroup analysis on the differences in adoption of analytics in different fields of business. If this information is available, it could be used to identify fields in which adding value by analytics would be most cost effective. This is of interest both from the company's side of view, but also from analyst's point of view in case one is looking for opportunities to do productive consulting.
