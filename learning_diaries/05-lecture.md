Today we discussed unsupervised learning, clustering and topic modelling. These are very relevant to Twitter analysis that is one topic for the course excersise.

I have not done natural language processing (NLP) and it was very interesting to get an introduction to this topic. I find myself being slightly skeptic when it comes to NLP and it's value.

First of all, Finnish is a very difficult language for both humans and machines. This poses a unique challenge when it comes to machine learning especially when it is combined with the small amount of native Finns. We don't get to benefit from the wide language base of e.g. English which already at this point has several NLP packages.

Even if we were able to parse Finnish adequately, we still have the inherent problem of making sense of the discussion. Language, association and understanding are still clear strengths of a human mind when compare to a computer. I am not certain of the value provided by NLP when compared to qualitative research. PhD Jukka Huhtam√§ki has done collaboration with qualitative researchers and I would love to hear about the results of this kind of interdisciplinary work.

When it comes to Twitter, I am afraid that making conclusions about a phenomenon (e.g. challenges of remote work) is very challenging due to bias in sampling. People discussing in Twitter do not represent the average person working remotely meaning that findings based on Twitter data do not necessarily generalize very well. Moreover, limiting the sample to Finnish discussion leads to a very small sample since Finnish is such a small language area. In the Twitter dataset provided for the excersise there are some 5000 tweets with significant number of retweets. This is a relatively small sample from machine learning point of view.

However I found the lecture very interesting and I am looking forward to the next one.
