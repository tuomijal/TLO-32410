Today we discussed the role of visualization in understanding data. This was especially interesting to me since I have always found the visualization process especially rewarding. As a process visualization resembles more handcrafting than analytics, you start with tools and components and come up with something unique and potentially beautiful. Despite the personal importance and satisfaction of visualization I found that I have always overlooked it's importance. I didn't know that information visualization is such a prominent and independent field with dedicated scientists and conferences. I have always considered visualization as a tool to communicate findings done in "more important" phases of work e.g. modelling.

This is obiviously not true as Jukka carefully explained and as is shown in Figure 1. In a previous lecture Jukka introduced us to the idea of facilitating human learning with data instead of implementing machine learning. Visualization is obiviously highly relevant when it comes to facilitating human learning and as such it is as important as modelling.

A good example of dedicating to visualization and going visualizations first is an award winning analyst [Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/about) who is the author of a extremely popular [Visual Cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/) website. In a blog post Nadieh described the way she got bored in tuning predictive models to more and more accurate percent by percent and moved from predictive analytics to visualization. I think this is anecdotal to the increasing importance of visualization and the independent importance of visualizing data. Besides, even if visualizations like Nadieh's wouldn't provide much insight, they are so stunningly beautiful that they [could be considered art](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/new-york-times-digital-trackers).
